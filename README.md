# GitHub Business Idea Generator

## Overview

This project is an AI-powered platform that generates creative business ideas from trending GitHub repositories. It scrapes popular repos, analyzes them using OpenAI GPT-4, rates the ideas, and serves them via a FastAPI backend for frontend consumption.

## Features

- Scrapes trending GitHub repositories
- Uses GPT-4 to generate business ideas based on repo data
- Rates each idea for originality, feasibility, market potential, and monetization clarity
- Stores results in business_ideas.json
- REST API endpoint to fetch ideas (`/ideas`)
- Secure API key and token management via .env
- Ready for cloud deployment (see `render.yaml`)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Configure environment variables**
   - Create a .env file:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
     GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-token
     ```

  Returns all generated business ideas in JSON format.

## Deployment

- Ready for deployment on [Render](https://render.com/) using [`render.yaml`](render.yaml).
